# C++ game

This is a library of games, written in C++. The games are nothing fancy, and
more will be added in the future.

To play, clone repo and run `make`.

## Hang Man

Allows the user to either play the game, which then will prompt for the numbers
of attempts allowed, and the number of hints given.

## C++ quiz

Simple C++ quiz I wrote for fun. Each question is worth 10 marks, must receive a
70 or more to pass.
